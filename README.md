# Djikstra's Implementation in real world application_Verilog
This project focusses on implementation of Djikistra's Algorithm using Verilog

Dijkstra's algorithm is a crucial tool in graph theory and computer science, with broad applications
in areas such as route planning and network optimization. The project
delves into the algorithm's core concepts, emphasizing its capacity to find
optimal paths while managing computational complexity. By providing a
step-by-step analysis of algorithm execution and demonstrating its
practical application through a real-world scenario, this project aims to
equip individuals and organizations with the knowledge and tools
necessary to leverage Dijkstra's algorithm for improved
Navigation and resource allocation.
